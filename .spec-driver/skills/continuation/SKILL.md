description: Write a prompt to help the next agent continue effectively.

Ensure /notes on the task card are up to date.

If there is already a 'New Agent Instructions' section, read and update it.
otherwise, create one, including:
- task card code
- required reading
- related documents
- key files
- relevant memories
- relevant doctrines
- any important user instructions or decisions
- any incomplete work or loose ends
- pending commit-state guidance, especially whether `.spec-driver` changes
  should be committed now to keep the worktree clean, and whether they should go
  out with code or separately per repo doctrine
- other advice or knowledge applicable to the next task(s)
- file paths for any files / documents referenced.

Then, print the path to the task card.

If the task card is a delta, use its `notes.md` file for onboarding, and
reference both it and the parent delta.

Then identify the next logical activity, and print instructions for the next agent.

Usually this means a simple instruction to invoke `/using-spec-driver` or one
of its target skills, with the appropriate artefact.

If the next step is implementation-adjacent or depends on `/preflight`, make
the handover explicitly preserve unresolved assumptions, questions, and design
tensions. Do not hand off with a vague "ready to proceed" if the bundle still
contains ambiguities the next agent should assess before coding.
