# Canonical Status Enums

## Requirement Lifecycle (canonical)

- `pending`
- `in-progress`
- `active`
- `retired`

## Change Artifact Lifecycle (canonical)

- `draft`
- `pending`
- `in-progress`
- `completed`
- `deferred`

Legacy alias:
- `complete` is normalized to `completed`

## Verification Coverage Statuses

- `planned`
- `in-progress`
- `verified`
- `failed`
- `blocked`

## Important Caveat

Revision lifecycle ingestion in requirements registry currently tolerates
non-canonical status strings from payloads (it does not hard-validate against
the canonical requirement enum on read).

Follow-up strict-mode work should apply one shared status-policy validator to
both write-time and read-time paths.

## Non-Canonical Terms to Avoid

- `implemented`
- `verified` (as requirement lifecycle status)
- `live`
- `archive`
