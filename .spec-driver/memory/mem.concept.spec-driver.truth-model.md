# Truth Model

## The Critical Distinction

Spec-driver maintains two complementary views of the system:

| | Specs | Contracts |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Intent and constraints | Observed truth |
| **Source** | Human-authored | Generated from code |
| **Answers** | What the system SHOULD be | What the system IS |
| **Stability** | Evergreen, evolves via revisions | Derived, regenerated on sync |

## The Rule

**Do not create competing sources of truth.**

- Specs should not duplicate full API signatures that contracts already capture
- Assembly specs should frame requirements as constraints that can be validated
  against contracts/code — not as authoritative copies of what the code exposes
- When specs and contracts disagree, that is a finding — not something to
  paper over

## In Practice

- Use [[mem.concept.spec-driver.contract|contracts]] for "what does the code expose?"
- Use [[mem.concept.spec-driver.spec|specs]] for "what requirements must the code satisfy?"
- Use [[mem.concept.spec-driver.audit|audits]] to detect and resolve disagreements
